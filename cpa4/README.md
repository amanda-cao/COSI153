In our consumerism-driven society, people are purchasing and paying for subscriptions and fees on a daily basis. In particular, younger groups of people, from teenagers to young adults, are at the forefront of such consumerism, but lack tangible applications to budget. A main contributor to this issue is that most of the budgeting apps available are mainly directed towards older populations who primarily want to keep track of larger financial spendings, such as loans and mortgages. The name of my budgeting app is Mite. Mite is a budgeting application that allows people to budget in a realistic and fun way through an interactive platform!


# Technology Notes

Some of the key features I used was a Keyboard shift component, which allows the screen to slide up and down as the user is inputting a text, such as the name parameter. This allows the user to always see what and where they are typing into, which is necessary for good usability. Another feature I am trying to implement is a navigation bar in the footer which allows the user to access each page at whichever pace they choose without having to go through each screen first. A new feature that I implemented that we have not learned yet was the keyboard shift component, but also implementing the icon as a button feature.
