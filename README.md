The name of this budgeting app is - MITE

Most budgeting apps nowadays are catered towards older professionals who mainly want to track bigger payments such as loans and mortgages. This app is designed for teenagers to younger professionals who want to keep track of daily spendings (i.e. food/dining, rent, groceries, etc.). Ideally this app would show financial breakdowns of spendings linked to your bank account, Venmo or even cash transactions.

# Technology Notes

The main features highlighted by this app is the navigation of different screens via buttons and taking users through a series of intuitive steps to set up their budgeting account (i.e. input name, create profile, etc.) The main packages being used are Button, Text, TextInput, FlatList, TouchableOpacity, and ScrollView. Using these packages allows for this app to be very user friendly and interactive. A new feature that I have used is to incorporate a KeyboardShift component that utilizes packages such as Animated, Dimensions, Keyboard, TextInput, and UIManager. This allows users to always see where and what they are typing into a TextInput box.
